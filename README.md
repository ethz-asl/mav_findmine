# mav_findmine
This repository implements a UAV system for automatic radar and camera surveys.

```

## Installation
The system uses [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) as middle ware to implement interfaces to various sensors and the [DJI Onboard SDK](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/).
Please follow the [supervised installation guide](install#installation-from-source) to install the versioned stack on the onboard computer as well as base station computer and RTK base station.

## Update
The custom dependencies are managed through [wstool](http://wiki.ros.org/wstool).
If not stated otherwise, update the following way.
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin clean -y
wstool update -j8
cd mav_findmine
git checkout v1.0.5
cd ..
wstool merge --merge-replace -y ./mav_findmine/install/dependencies.rosinstall
wstool update -j8
catkin build
```

## User manual
The user workflow to perform a survey with either camera or radar is organized in the following steps:
1. [Plan a mission offline](libs/fm_mission_planner)
2. Setup the field test sequentially<br>
2.1 Survey the base station position ([old](https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_findmine/wiki/05-RTK-Base-Setup#geodetic-survey)/[new](https://github.com/ethz-asl/ethz_piksi_ros/tree/master/piksi_multi_interface#usage))<br>
2.2 Power the UAV
3. Upload the mission file into the `/home/$USER/trajectories` folder on the UAV
4. [Configure the mission](integration/fm_missions#mission-configuration) on the UAV<br>
```configure_mission $UAV_NAME```
5. Open the mission control center<br>
```mission_control $UAV_NAME```
6. Load the trajectory on the UAV<br>
```trajectory_start $UAV_NAME my_trajectory.yaml```
7. Inspect the trajectory in the mission control center and press<br>
<kbd>approve trajectory</kbd>
8. The resulting sensor logs are placed in a folder `/home/$USER/bags/YYMMDDHHMMSS`

## Structure
The repository is separated into two main categories.

### integration
The packages in the [integration folder](integration) gather different external dependencies into single system applications.
| Package                                | Summary                                                                                |
